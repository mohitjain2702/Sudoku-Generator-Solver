Sudoku Solver and Generator

This Java project offers a Sudoku puzzle generator and solver. Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9 so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (boxes) contains all the digits without repetition. With this project, you can generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties and automatically solve them using a backtracking algorithm. The console-based interface provides a simple way to interact with the puzzles. Simply run SudokuGenerator.java to create a new Sudoku puzzle and use SudokuSolver.java to find the solution. Customization options are available by adjusting code parameters. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
